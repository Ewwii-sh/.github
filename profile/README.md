# Ewwii

**Ewwii** (ElKowar's Wacky Widgets improved interface) is a fork of **Eww** (ElKowar's Wacky Widgets) which is a widget system made in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which lets you create your own widgets similarly to how you can in AwesomeWM.

Ewwii supports a custom package manager named `eiipm` which can be used to install themes, packages, binaries etc. which can be used to configure ewwii.
