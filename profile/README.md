<h1 align="start">Ewwii</h1>

<p align="start">
<b>Ewwii</b> is a Rust-based GTK widget system and a fork of <b>Eww</b>. 
It allows developers to create and compose custom widgets, configure them with scripts and expressions, 
and manage themes, packages, and binaries using its custom package manager <code>eiipm</code>. 
With built-in configuration libraries and developer tooling, Ewwii aims to simplify GUI development while remaining flexible and extensible.
</p>

<p align="start">
Designed for both hobbyists and power users, Ewwii makes it easy to experiment with layouts, 
customize your interface, and extend functionality with minimal boilerplate. 
Its modular architecture encourages reusable components and smooth integration of new widgets.
